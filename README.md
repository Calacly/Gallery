# Mini Image Gallery
>Image gallery with search to find your favourite images

`Mini Image Gallery` was created as a personal project in order to improve my skills. You are of course welcome to change it - I'm sure any change would be an improvement :)

# Purpose
* A quick and easy way to search for your favourite photos from any device
* Images are displayed in a responsive grid using CSS Grid and are zoomed in on hover
* Images flip when they are clicked or tapped and display the image name as well as information about the image using the Unsplash API (This functionality is a work in progress)
